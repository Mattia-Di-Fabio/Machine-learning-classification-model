# Competitive_data_science_project_Titanic

In this folder we present a full analysis of a database available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) with the goal to predict the survivor of the Titanic disaster. This is a problem that can be addressed with machine learning classification techniques. 

## File in the repository

#### Titanic_From_EDA_to_predictions:

In this file you can find the full notebook written in Python to predict the survivors of the Titanic disaster. Inside the file you will find comments, explanations and justifications of all the necessary steps from the exploratory data analysis to the choice of the classification algorithm and the predictions.

## Actual Result

The model is currently submitted to Kaggle where we are in the top 20% of the leaderboard with an accuracy of 78.225%.
